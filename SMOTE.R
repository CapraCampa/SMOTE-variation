# simulate data
# where each dataset has different parameters
# (size of the dataset and proportion of rare examples over all examples)


# balance dataset with SMOTE
# balance dataset with SMOTE variant


#apply models (tree and logistic regression) to datasets

#compute metrics to compare our variant to the original technique
